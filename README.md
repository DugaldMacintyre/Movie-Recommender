## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
We both love movies, discovering new ones, and talking about them! Hence, we decided we wanted to explore recommendation systems and create our own application that suggests films to us. Through this, we wanted to gain experience creating full-stack applications, databases, and data science concepts. Further, we both like to work in a team and discuss ideas and this felt like the perfect opportunity. We hope you enjoy!

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
### app.py
Main file where routes and requests are taken care. Film recommendations are calculated and returned here. Reviews are also dealt with.

### helpers.py
Helper functions to recommend movies and add reviews are. 

### testing.ipynb
A data cleaning pipeline and write the new dataframe to a cv for use in the application. Testing of content-based and collaborative recommender systems.
